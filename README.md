- 👋 HEY!!! I’m @Rhea-Eve
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things! Functional languages, bioinformatics, and I am dabbling in some systems and PL stuff. Anything that is math-y, hard, but also relevant.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about systems stuff, 'hacking', LLMs, and more about all the things above.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to the above stuff or anything I have here that seems unfinished. (Although, on second thought I am mostly working on a lot of private repos so yeah idk...:)
- 📫 Reach me at rheakarty[at]gmail.com
